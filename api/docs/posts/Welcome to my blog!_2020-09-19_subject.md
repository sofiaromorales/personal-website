# Welcome to my blog
<br/><br/>
**Welcome everybody!** happy that you are here reading this and welcome to my blog, this space is for sharing my thoughts and experiences with you all.  

To introduce myself a little better Iâ€™m Sofia Rodriguez, a 20 yrs old software engineer student from Venezuela. I do web and iOS dev, besides programming I like teaching, reading books, and exercising. I spend most of my time working on clients or personal projects and learning new stuff. I consider myself a very techie person, most of itâ€™s about Apple, so so Iâ€™ll be writing a lot about it for sure.  

This website has been live for some months now, but I decided I want to start writing and thatâ€™s the reason why I created this blog section. Iâ€™m kinda new to this whole writing thing but Iâ€™ll try to write at least 2 posts every month. Some of the topics Iâ€™ll cover are:

ðŸŒŸ My experience and advice on the computer science field  
ðŸŒŸ Programming tutorials  
ðŸŒŸ Tech reviews  
ðŸŒŸ Random stuff  

**Wish me luck!**
